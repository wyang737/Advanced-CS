Projects:

  Scrabble: Designed a program to "solve scrabble" - find the highest scoring letter combination given a "hand" of 7 letters and a preset table of values that corresponds letters to a number value. Used a dictionary class that was given and a text file of all possible words.
  
  Maze Solver: First created a circular queue class, a queue that is based on arrays and efficient by looping around the beginning if possible. Then, used the aforementioned queue in a breadth first search, efficiently finding the shortest path through a maze.
