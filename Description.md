Projects:

Scrabble: Designed a program to "solve scrabble" - find the highest scoring letter combination given a "hand" of 7 letters and a preset table of values that corresponds letters to a number value. Used a dictionary class that was given and a text file of all possible words.
  
Maze Solver: First created a circular queue class, a queue that is based on arrays and efficient by looping around the beginning if possible. Then, used the aforementioned queue in a breadth first search, efficiently finding the shortest path through a maze. 

Math Year Game: Original problem was to create a program to come up with the expressions that make up the numbers 1-99 using the numbers 2018 (http://mathforum.org/yeargames/) Problem started out by implementing a program to solve expressions, and the next step is to generate all the expressions (still a work in progress)
